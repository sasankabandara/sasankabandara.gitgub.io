        <p>
          Hi there, I'm Sasanka Bandara! I am a software engineering
          undergraduate with a passion for technology and a hunger for
          knowledge. I believe that technology can make the world a better
          place, and that's why I am dedicated to learning and mastering the
          latest tools and techniques in the field.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, my focus is on machine learning, which I find fascinating.
          I enjoy the challenge of creating algorithms that can learn and
          improve on their own, and I look forward to exploring the many
          exciting applications of this technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to machine learning, I have experience with a wide range
          of programming languages and tools. I am proficient in JavaScript,
          SQL, Java, React.js, Python, Laravel, MERN stack, Jupyter Notebooks,
          CSS, Java EE, and PHP. I'm always excited to learn new things and take
          on new challenges.
